# Santa Commands It


Tell Santa what you want for Christmas

## Quick Start

First you will need to clone this repo

``` shell
$ git clone https://github.com/wylie/sci.git
```

Then you have to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) if it already isn't installed.

After node is installed you have two more commands to run

```shell
$ npm install
$ grunt start
```

The first command will install all the needed packages, like [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).

The second command will install other site dependencies like my version of [Recess](https://github.com/wylie/recess.git) as well as any [Bower](http://bower.io) dependencies. Then it will do an initial build for you.

The server will be on port 3000. You can open another browser window and type in the address, or you can just click [here](http://localhost:3000).

After all that you are free to develop as you need to. I would open another command line window in which to do all your dirty work.

**Enjoy!**
