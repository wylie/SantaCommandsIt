# Santa Commands It


Tell Santa what you want for Christmas

## Getting Started

First you will need to clone this repo

``` shell
$ git clone https://github.com/wylie/sci.git
```

Then you have to install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) if it already isn't installed.

After node is installed you have two more commands to run

```shell
$ npm install
$ grunt start
```

The first command will install all the needed packages, like [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com).
The second command will install other site dependencies like my version of [Recess](https://github.com/wylie/recess.git) and any [Bower](http://bower.io) dependencies.

After that you can run this command to start a server:
```shell
$ grunt server
```

That will start a local server on port 3000. You can open another browser window to get there, or just click [here](http://localhost:3000).
